# Artist-Website

Created a mock website for an artist (happens to be my mother!)
I have previously used traditional website builders for her website, but have created one from scratch that will over-take her current one.

The aim was to create a website from scratch utilising Bootstrap 5.2.I found Boostrap quite easy to use, with many of its key features easy to work with. I created a carousel on the homepage with a fade. 
The gallery page was simple to set up using the grid function in Bootstrap. 
Some custom CSS was used to ensure font style & colours etc. were consistent. It was also improtant to ensure all images were repsonsive and viewable on mobile.

Future enhancements
I'd like to get more creative with the gallery page. Potentially looking at modals for each image that will provide a description of what it is.
